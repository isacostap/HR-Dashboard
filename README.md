People Analytics in Power BI: Tracking Key HR Metrics


This is an HR dashboard I built in Power BI, designed to provide a clear and data-driven view of workforce dynamics.

ðŸ“Œ Key metrics included:
âœ” Hiring and turnover rates â€“ tracking employee inflow and outflow over time.
âœ” Turnover percentage â€“ measuring workforce replacement to identify retention patterns.
âœ” Current headcount â€“ total number of active employees.
âœ” Total payroll costs â€“ an overview of salary expenses.
âœ” Gender and age distribution â€“ demographic breakdown of the workforce.
âœ” Organizational structure â€“ employees categorized by department and job level.
âœ” Hiring trends â€“ monitoring recruitment patterns over time.
âœ” Average salary by department â€“ comparing compensation across different business areas.

These insights help assess workforce stability and guide strategic decisions on retention, pay equity, and talent planning.
